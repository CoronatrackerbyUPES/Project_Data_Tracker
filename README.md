The key delieverables in Ver1.0 are as per my understanding:
Android app/Mobile App to ytrack movement of Corona Suspects/NRIs/Patients
Features of App:
1. Cloud Enabled app server to
  a. collate the movement on maps
  b. Alerts to loacl authority at least one on movement
  c. Mandatory registration of Corona Patient on the app by LIU/Police/Panchayat.
  d.Self Declaration of patient/suspect/NRI on the app - which takes over the GIS of the phone owned by the person
